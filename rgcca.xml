RGCCA
==================================

**Description**

We consider J data matrices X1 ,..., XJ.  Each n × pj data matrix Xj = [ xj1, ..., xjpj ] is called a block and represents a set
of pj variables observed on n individuals. The number and the nature of the variables may differ from one block to another,
but the individuals must be the same across blocks. We assume that all variables are centered. The objective of RGCCA is to find,
for each block, a weighted composite of variables (called block component) yj = Xjaj, j = 1 ,..., J (where a j is a column-vector with pj
elements) summarizing the relevant information between and within the blocks. The block components are obtained such that (i) block
components explain well their own block and/or (ii) block components that are assumed to be connected are highly correlated.
As a component-based method, RGCCA can provide users with graphical representations to visualize the sources
of variability within blocks and the amount of correlation between blocks.

**Input file**

- *blocks* (.tsv, .csv or .txt) : tabulated files containing variables to analyse together. The samples should be in lines and labelled and variables in columns with a header.
- *connection* (.tsv, .csv or .txt) : tabulated files without header, containing a symmetric matrix with either 0 or 1 for a connection between each block.
- *response* (.tsv, .csv or .txt) : an only column of a qualitative variable.

**Working example**

    | From Russett data (RGCCA package) : https://github.com/BrainAndSpineInstitute/rgcca_Rpackage/tree/master/data
    | Use *agriculture.tsv* as dataset. Add *industry.tsv* and *politic.tsv* as new dataset. Eventually, use *response.tsv* as group of response in analysis custom settings.

**Output files**

- *corcircle* (.pdf) : samples projected in a space composed by the first two components of the analysis (with the percent of explained variance). By selecting a response, samples are colored according to this criterion.
- *samples_space* (.pdf) : circle of correlation of variables with the first two components of the analysis (with the percent of  explained variance). The dotted circle corresponds to a 0.5 correlation and the full one corresponds to a 1 correlation.
- *fingerprint* (.pdf) : 100 best biomarkers for a set of blocks according to the weight of these variables in the analysis (eigen value for PCA, canonical variable for CCA, component for PLS and RGCCA).
- *ave* (.pdf) : average variance explained (in %) in the model for each block ranked decreasingly.
